                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Your monthly mortgage payment includes loan principal and interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and mortgage insurance (PMI), if applicable. While not typically included in your mortgage payment, homeowners also pay monthly utilities and sometimes pay homeowners association (HOA) fees, so it's a good idea to factor these into your monthly budget. This mortgage calculator factors in all these typical monthly costs so you can really crunch the numbers.

                    This formula assumes a fixed-rate mortgage, where the interest rate remains constant throughout the loan term. And remember, youâ€™ll still need to add on taxes, insurance, utilities, and HOA fees if applicable.
